        Suppose we are looking for numbers that could add up to a certain integrally positive number n
        and the number of ways such a number could be summed up."\n"
        The following is our investigation, keeping in mind one that 1 cannot be summed up in the
        set of integers as it symbolises unity."\n"
        Thus we begin at the very first of prime and even numbers <b>2</b> a combination which makes

            A series is a summation of elements per row, and the terms categorise the levels of summations

        It is well established that if n is any integer then  <i>n + (n + 1)</i> is an odd number."\n"
        Example: "\n"4 + 3 = 1"\n" 7 + 6 = 11 or -7 + (-7 - 1) = -7 + (-8) = -15 "\n"
        However, there is another way of generating a set of odd numbers and it goes as follows:"\n"
        <i>(n(n + n) - n)/n = (n(2n) - n)/n</i> "\n"
        <i>= (2n<sup>2</sup> - n)/n</i>
        "\n\n"

        Example: If we choose 3 and substitute it into the formua above,"\n\n"

        If we equate the 2 expressions above whic, each, generate a set of odd number we get: "\n"

        Solving <i>n</i>:"\n"
        <i>(2n<sup>2</sup> - n) = n(n + (n - 1))</i>"\n"

        <i>(2n<sup>2</sup> - n) = (2n<sup>2</sup> - n)</i>"\n"
        The LHS is equal to the RHS as it can be seen.
